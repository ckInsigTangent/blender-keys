#+TITLE: Extract all Blender hotkeys and operators into Org mode files.

This tool produces two Org mode files from Blender internals: the
first holds tables showing all Blender hotkeys, the second lists all
operators available to the Python API.

* Hotkeys

The first Org mode file is named =blender-keys.org=.  The tables it
contains give a quick description for all Blender keys.  The result is
edited and sorted in a way that pleases the author of the tool :-),
but tastes may vary.  Don't hesitate to adjust things so it sorts
and edits your way!

The generated tables help me to get the meaning of a key when I read
documentation saying /Use that particular key/ without explaining what
it does.  At other times, when I'm not fully sure I correctly remember
a key, I may check it first so to not accidentally hurt myself.

Within recent versions of Blender, such information is interactively
available in the /Input/ tab of /User Preferences/ (Shift Ctrl U).  On the
first line, switch /Name/ to /Key-Binding/ then type the wanted key after
the looking glass, in the box next to it.

I saw many Blender hotkeys tables on the Internet, but most often,
they are outdated, incomplete, and sometimes erroneous.  Some sites
even rely on collaborating users for completing or correcting the
tables, leaving the feeling that they are never going to be
dependable.  This is why I decided to derive such a table directly
from Blender using its Python API, so it gets complete and accurate.

* Operators

The second Org mode file is named =operators.org=, which lists all
available operators in the Python API.  The first level headers use
/bpy.ops.NAME/, where /NAME/ is the module name, and are sorted by that
name.  The second level headers are the textual description of the
operator, sorted by that description.  The content is the remainder of
the template for the Python call, starting with a dot: this is to be
concatenated after the text of the first level headers.

Whenever the textual description of an operator is missing within
Blender, the name of the Python method is taken as the description.

Within Blender, the same information may be produced in non-Org format
by the /Help/ â†’ /Operator Cheat Sheet/ command, yet the result of this
command is not immediately available.  To see it, switch the type of
some window to /Text Editor/, click on the icon immediately right of the
/Templates/ menu and select /OperatorList.txt/ from there.

* Other notes

The tool has been written using Blender 2.68a, and is sensitive to the
version of Blender: I noticed it does not work for Blender 2.63.
Either use the generated =blender-keys.org= and =operators.org= files, or
adjust and use the included Makefile for creating them afresh.

Daniel Schalla created http://blenderkeys.be-untitled.eu/, which is a
Web application interrogating the data produced by this tool, here.

Have fun with this.  My only demand is that you share with me any
interesting improvement you develop! :-)
